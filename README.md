#C# i18n Gettext Utilities#

This solution contains a series of classes, templates and tools to make Gettext usage in C# as easy as possible, plus some general i18n resources that can be applied regardless of the internationalization mechanism being used. It provides T4 templates for easily creating static translation functions, resource managers to obtain data from po files or database tables, po files parser, tools for extracting strings from ASP NET code, ASP NET controls for translating strings in page files, batch files for automating the extraction process, and more.
